# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-14

Alignment with Laravel's official [`laravel/agent-skills`](https://github.com/laravel/agent-skills) pack — adopt its primitives and conventions, defer to its tools, and position this team as a complement rather than a competitor.

### Added

- **Skills primitive.** New `skills/laravel-conventions/` skill (`SKILL.md` + `reference/antipatterns.md`) — an idiomatic-Laravel "which primitive, which antipattern" reference that auto-triggers on convention questions. Wired into both plugin manifests via `"skills": "./skills/"`.
- **Cursor support.** `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` + `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` mirror the Claude manifests so the pack installs in Cursor too.
- **"Pairs with the official Laravel pack" README section** — recommends co-installing `laravel`, `laravel-cloud`, and `laravel-nightwatch`, and explains how the work divides (Boost owns framework bumps, `laravel-simplifier` owns after-the-fact cleanup, the official skills own Cloud/Nightwatch).
- **CI manifest checks** extended to validate the Cursor manifests, keep Claude/Cursor `name`+`version` in sync with `VERSION`, and lint `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

### Changed

- **`/upgrade-laravel` defers to Laravel Boost.** Recommends Boost's `/upgrade-laravel-v13`, `/upgrade-livewire-v4`, `/upgrade-inertia-v3` for the framework diff and scopes itself to the surrounding work (PHP runtime, package compat, structural 10 → 11 audit, verification).
- **Coding-standard alignment with `laravel-simplifier`.** `tech-lead` gains a "Clarity & simplification" review axis (no nested ternaries → `match`, explicit return types, early returns, clarity over brevity, behavior-preserving). `backend-developer` and `frontend-developer` pick up the matching antipatterns.
- Plugin/marketplace metadata enriched (`displayName`, `metadata.description`, per-plugin `author`/`category`); bumped to **1.1.0**.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-14

First tagged release. The pack is now installable as a Claude Code plugin, the
guardrail scripts are tested in CI, and the agent/command roster has grown.

### Added

- **Claude Code plugin packaging.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` make the whole pack installable with
  `/plugin marketplace add HamzaAlayed/laravel-claude-agents` then
  `/plugin install laravel-team@laravel-claude-agents`. No more `curl | bash`
  required (the installer is still supported).
- **Plugin hooks manifest** (`hooks/hooks.json`) wiring the three guardrail
  scripts via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` so they resolve from the installed plugin
  directory.
- **`performance-engineer` agent** — profiling, N+1/query optimization, caching
  strategy, queue/Horizon throughput, Octane, OPcache, and Core Web Vitals.
  Measures first, hands fixes to the right builder, never optimizes on a hunch.
- **Four new slash commands:** `/add-test`, `/review-pr`, `/optimize-query`,
  `/upgrade-laravel`.
- **Zero-dependency test harness** (`tests/guardrails.test.sh`) covering all
  three guardrail scripts, including the no-`jq`/no-`python3` fallback path.
- **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): shellcheck, the guardrail
  test harness (run twice — with and without `jq`), JSON manifest validation,
  and agent/command frontmatter linting.
- **Repo hygiene:** `LICENSE` (MIT), `VERSION`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  and `docs/authoring-agents.md`.

### Changed

- **Guardrail scripts no longer fail open when `jq` is missing.** They now
  degrade `jq` → `python3` → raw-payload scan, so a missing JSON parser can no
  longer silently disable a security guard.
- **Broader destructive-SQL matching.** Multiline statements are flattened before
  matching, `UPDATE ... SET` now recognizes table aliases
  (`UPDATE orders AS o SET ...`), and `DROP` covers `TABLE`/`DATABASE`/`SCHEMA`/`INDEX`.
- **`protect-env-files.sh`** uses a boundary-aware regex that matches protected
  `.env*` files in both a clean path and the raw payload, while still allowing
  `.env.example`.
